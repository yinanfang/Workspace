From: <adamsm@cs.unc.edu>To: <jeffay@cs.unc.edu>Hey Kevin, do you really think we should use SMTP as a class project in COMP 431 this year? The smart students are going to figure out automated ways to send anonymous SPAM to the world!From: <student-who-wants-to-get-an-A@cs.unc.edu>To: <jeffay@cs.unc.edu>Dr. J, I just wanted to tell you that I think these SMTP programming assignments are the coolest thing! I really like learning how a real-life protocol for a real-life Internet service really works.
Thanks!
